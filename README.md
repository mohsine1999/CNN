Excited to share my latest project as a Master's student in Decisional Computer Science at the Faculty of Sciences and Techniques of Beni Mellal. I adapted a neural network for digit classification (images) with a 97.80% classification rate using Python and OpenCV libraries. #MachineLearning #Python #OpenCV #DigitClassification
